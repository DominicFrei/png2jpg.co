				Absolutely! Your images never leave your device. All conversions happen directly in your
				browser using JavaScript. We don't upload, store, or have access to any of your files. This
				makes our converter 100% private and secure.

				What's the maximum file size I can convert?

			</summary>
			<p class="mt-3 text-xs text-gray-600 sm:mt-4 sm:text-sm">
				Since conversions happen in your browser, the limit depends on your device's memory. Most
				modern devices can easily handle images up to 50MB. For very large files, you may experience
				slower conversion times.

				Yes! You can select or drag multiple images at once. They'll all be converted to your
				selected output format. This batch processing feature saves time when working with many
				images.

				Why should I use WebP format?

			</summary>
			<p class="mt-3 text-xs text-gray-600 sm:mt-4 sm:text-sm">
				WebP offers superior compression compared to traditional formats. It's typically 25-35%
				smaller than JPG and PNG files while maintaining similar quality. It supports both lossy and
				lossless compression, plus transparency. Most modern browsers support WebP.

				Will converting my image reduce its quality?
				<span class="ml-2 text-gray-400 transition-transform group-open:rotate-180">▼</span>
			</summary>
			<p class="mt-3 text-xs text-gray-600 sm:mt-4 sm:text-sm">
				It depends on the formats. Converting to JPG uses lossy compression which may slightly
				reduce quality. Converting to PNG maintains quality but may increase file size. We use
				high-quality settings (90% for JPG) to minimize any visible quality loss.

				Can I convert animated GIFs?

			</summary>
			<p class="mt-3 text-xs text-gray-600 sm:mt-4 sm:text-sm">
				Currently, animated GIFs will be converted to static images (first frame only). Full
				animation preservation during conversion requires specialized handling that we're planning
				to add in the future.
